Eradication of COVID-19 through the cellular clearance approach

## Overview

CellClear proposes to use data and communal will to eradicate COVID-19. Each cell is a geographic area encompassing a number of households. Within each cell, data regarding viral symptoms and contact events are supplied by residents. As cells are declared clear (i.e. free of COVID-19) they are then able to commune with other nearby cleared cells, such that entire regions are then able to resume normal daily life and economic activity. This will be acheived faster than would otherwise be the case under national level lockdowns. It is possible to implement this solution without government involvement or assistance. Nor is there a requirement for any equipment beyond the existing extent of mobile phone ownership.

## Background

The COVID-19 pandemic has presented the world with enormous challenges. The direct cost in human lives is appalling. Tragically, the lockdown measures implemented will have a further, perhaps larger cost in terms of public health. Yet lockdown measures are necessary because from an ethical standpoint our society refuses to accept the unnecessary loss of so many lives. 

So, what is the most expedient method for getting back to normal life, for getting our economies running again? We collectively hope for a vaccine, but it would appear this could take years and success is not assured. What about "herd immunity"? The UK flirted with this concept before performing a complete U-turn. It seems that to aim for herd immunity is to hand a otherwise avoidable death sentence to many. Furthermore, there is currently no strong evidence that an individual cannot be re-infected with COVID-19. 


However, I would contend that it is possible for our society to eradicate COVID. It is 2020, we live in the information age and I think we can outsmart this bastard of a virus. Epidemiologists ...
